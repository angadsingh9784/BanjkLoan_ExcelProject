Detailed Description and Overview
I recently developed two interactive dashboards in Excel that are interconnected through dynamic buttons and provide insightful visualizations with real-time interactivity. These dashboards were designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing, with a focus on making data exploration seamless.

Key Features:
Interlinked Dashboards:
Both dashboards are connected through buttons, allowing users to switch between them effortlessly without disrupting the data flow.

Dynamic Filtering and Drill-down:
The dashboards include dynamic filters that enable users to drill down into specific categories or metrics and instantly update charts and tables accordingly.

Interactive Buttons for Navigation:
Navigation between different views and sections is smooth, thanks to clickable buttons that enhance the user experience.

Real-Time Data Updates:
Any change in the underlying data automatically reflects across the dashboards, ensuring users always see up-to-date insights.

Visually Engaging Layout:
The dashboards are crafted with attention to detail, including clear labels, color-coded charts, and well-organized sections that make the data easy to interpret.

Use Case:
This project can be applied across various industries, such as retail sales analysis, marketing campaign performance tracking, and financial reporting. The goal was to demonstrate how Excel can be leveraged beyond its traditional use for static spreadsheets by creating a powerful, dynamic, and interactive reporting tool.
